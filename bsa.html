	<label>Bait and Switch Attack</label>
			<p>
				
				Using trusted marketing methods such as paid-for advertising on websites, attackers can trick you into visiting malicious sites. When websites sell advertising space, it can be purchased by rogue attackers. The bona fide advertisement can be replaced with a ‘bad’ link that can be used to download malware, lock up your browser, or compromise your systems.Alternatively, the advertisement may link to a legitimate website, but it will be programmed to redirect you to a harmful site.
